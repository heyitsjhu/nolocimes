# Server-Side Configurations

Configurations defined in this folder _should not_ be used on the client-side. Anything that is included in the client-side code is _visible_ to the outside world. You _don't_ want your API KEYS or other sensitive information to be seen by the public. _*Keep this in mind!*_
